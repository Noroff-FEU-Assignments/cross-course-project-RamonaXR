    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[The first thing I would advise, is to ensure all passwords are strong and secure. It's essential to use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be changed regurarly, and website owners should encourage their users to do the same. 
      Keeping software up to date is also crucial for website security. Outdated software can have vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Website owners should ensure that all software, including the operating system, web server, and applications, are updated regurarly.
      Using SSL certificates is another important step in securing a website. SSL certificates encrypt data transmitted between the website and it's users, making it more difficult for hackers to steal sensitive information. Website owners should ensure that their SSL certificates are up to date and that they are using the latest encryption protocols
      Website owners should also consider implementing security plugins and firewall to protect their website from attacks.
      It's also important to have a backup plan in place, in case of an attack. Website owners should regurarly back up their website data and store it in a secure location. In conclusion, securing a website from security attacks requires a multi-layered approach and a backup plan in place to quickly restore their website.  ]</p>
